            <p>Hello! I am Trần Thanh Bình, a 4th-year Software Engineering student at Nguyễn Tất Thành University. With a strong passion for technology and problem-solving, I have developed a solid foundation in programming languages such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and C#. Throughout my academic journey, I have worked on various projects that have honed my skills in web development, database management, and software design.

                As I approach graduation, I am eager to apply my knowledge and skills in real-world scenarios. I am always seeking opportunities to learn, grow, and contribute to innovative projects that make a difference. My goal is to become a proficient software engineer who can tackle complex challenges and create impactful solutions.
